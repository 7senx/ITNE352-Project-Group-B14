# ITNE 352 Project Report

## Introduction

Within the context of modern education at the University of Bahrain, the ITNE352 course focuses on developing proficiency with contemporary technology. A key project in this course is the Multithreaded News Client/Server Information System, aimed at facilitating efficient sharing and obtaining of breaking news updates.

### Project Description

The goal of the project is to create a client-server system using Python scripts. The server component handles multiple client connections, responds to client requests, and retrieves news updates from the NewsAPI.org service. The client script establishes a connection with the server, provides a user-friendly menu, queries the server, and displays the responses.

#### Client Code

The client script is implemented in Python, utilizing the socket module for smooth communication between client and server objects. It features a user-friendly interface and structured data transmission using JSON encoding for scalability and interoperability.

#### Server Code

The server code configures a server to accept connections, respond to client requests, and communicate with the NewsAPI interface. Functions include server setup, client handling, response handling, and a main block to start the server.

#### GUI Code

The GUI code provides a solid foundation for a News Client application using Tkinter. It includes functionalities for client initialization, frame navigation, user interface, data communication, functionality, displaying data, and basic error handling.

## Recommended Design Guidelines

The project description offers design principles including starting with a basic Python server, implementing API integration, and adding threads for handling multiple connections.
